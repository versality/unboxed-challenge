# Unboxed Challenge

## Framework
### Why Sinatra ?
RoR would be an obvious choice for a majority of the projects, however Rails does a lot of things for developers automagically and some might not understand what is happening behind the scene.
My intention here was to demonstrate that I am capable of creating a project from base bones, going with minimalistic approach where every part matters for this particular task. 
Every bit was specifically made around the challenge.

## Specs
### VCR
Initial spec requests will be recorded into appropriate cassettes for speed and consistency.

## Setup

```Bash
> bundle
> rackup config.ru
```

## Test

```Bash
> rspec
```
